This Specialization is offered by University California, San Diego on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data).

## Introduction
You will gain an understanding of what insights big data can provide through hands-on experience with the tools and systems used by big data scientists and engineers. By following along with provided code, you will experience how one can perform predictive modeling and leverage graph analytics to model problems. This specialization will prepare you to ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and do basic exploration of large, complex datasets. In the final Capstone Project, developed in partnership with data software company Splunk, youâ€™ll apply the skills you learned to do basic analyses of big data.
